## Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

I work as an independent contractor (for now) building systems to help businesses solve problems.

Many projects are private, however I can sometimes publish portions here, on my GitHub.

Feel free to take a look around here, or the content on [my website](https://jacklabbe.com).
