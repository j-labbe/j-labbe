## Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

Feel free to take a look around my public projects!

I work as an independent contractor (for now) building systems to help businesses solve problems. Right now, my largest projects is a cloud-based data management system (unfortunately it must remain in a private repo for security reasons).

Feel free to check out my [website](https://jacklabbe.com) for some more info about me. The source code is right here on GitHub, too!
